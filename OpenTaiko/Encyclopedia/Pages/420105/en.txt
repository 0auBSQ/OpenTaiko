[Image Drawing]

func:DrawGraphRectCenter(x, y, rect_x, rect_y,
	rect_width, rect_height, "filename");
Draw a given image at a position, centered at the
given coordinates.

A rectangle is used to specify what portion of the
image you want to draw.

If a rectangle goes outside the bounds of the given
image, it will loop back to continue drawing.
This method can be used to repeat textures.
