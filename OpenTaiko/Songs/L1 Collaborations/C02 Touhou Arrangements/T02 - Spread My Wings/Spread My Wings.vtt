00:27.000 --> 00:32.250
Flames surrounding me.

00:32.250 --> 00:39.000
Walking through the depths of hell

00:39.000 --> 00:44.250
I can't take control

00:44.250 --> 00:51.000
of the fire that burns inside

00:51.000 --> 00:54.000
Come now, feel the wrath.

00:54.000 --> 00:57.000
I've walked through this God forsaken path.

00:57.000 --> 00:59.625
Nothing scares me now.

00:59.625 --> 01:02.625
I've risen to the skies.

01:02.625 --> 01:05.250
I will spread my wings

01:05.250 --> 01:08.625
Reach my hands up far beyond the universe

01:08.625 --> 01:14.625
Nothing could hold me back

01:14.625 --> 01:18.000
Breaking free I'll go fourth and

01:18.000 --> 01:20.250
embrace the new and the better me

01:20.250 --> 01:27.188
I'll achieve it all just wait and see
