00:38.710 --> 00:41.226
World flashed before my eyes

00:41.216 --> 00:44.323
I thought that I had met my demise

00:44.323 --> 00:47.419
Without a doubt I feared for my life

00:47.419 --> 00:51.097
Running away to hide from all the red dark skies

00:51.097 --> 00:53.613
"This is not the way to go"

00:53.613 --> 00:56.710
I told myself now because I know

00:56.710 --> 00:59.806
No one will be fighting this war for me

00:59.806 --> 01:02.710
My fate is up to me don't you see

01:03.484 --> 01:06.000
Ready or not here I come

01:06.000 --> 01:09.097
I won't back down till the battle's done

01:09.097 --> 01:12.097
All that pain has led up to this day

01:12.097 --> 01:15.290
So you'd better not get in my way

01:15.290 --> 01:18.387
I hope you've prepped yourself enough tonight

01:18.387 --> 01:21.484
Cuz I'm not backing down without a fight

01:21.484 --> 01:24.581
Taking a big step out drawing my knife

01:24.581 --> 01:28.452
Because tonight someone's losing their life

01:40.065 --> 01:43.161
I hope you've prepped yourself enough tonight

01:43.161 --> 01:46.258
Cuz I'm not backing down without a fight

01:46.258 --> 01:49.355
Taking a big step out drawing my knife

01:49.355 --> 01:53.226
Because tonight someone's losing their life
