# TJAPlayer3-Develop-BSQ
TJAPlayer3-Develop-ReWriteのフォーク, 太鼓の達人 ニジイロVerを切っ掛けに開発したシミュレーター

# In progress

Ver. 0.3.4

Will update this readme later.

This Taiko no Tatsujin simulator is a touhourenren's TJAPlayer3-Develop-ReWrite fork, fixing multiple bugs and adding multiple features to make it closer than the arcade Nijiiro version and planning to add various original features later (Like PS2 Taiko Towers type charts handling, an adventure/story mode, a way to unlock puchicharas/charts with coins earned after each play and so on)

I can't share the skin for obvious reasons (Wouldn't take the risk of getting sued lol)

But you can reconstitute the skin yourself following the `README_SKIN.md` guide.

(`README_SKIN.md` guide will be updated at each skin update, please take a look at it each time you download an update to be sure you don't miss any required asset)

Self-made assets will be distributed separately.
