You look at me like that

Why do Why do Why do

00:29.655 --> 00:32.414
You insist on eye contact

Why do Why do Why do

00:35.172 --> 00:37.931
You believe you know why I just blinked

00:40.690 --> 00:43.448
You believe you know how I think

You

01:39.483 --> 01:45.172
And the masks I make are painted
with a brush of iridescent selfhood

01:45.172 --> 01:50.345
And if it inspires you to dive deeper into yourself, good!
