00:00.732 --> 00:07.683
another day has passed

00:07.683 --> 00:13.902
and you've awakened as always

00:13.902 --> 00:20.488
each and every million of stars, you're all

00:20.488 --> 00:25.427
finally with me at last

00:25.427 --> 00:33.659
so i ask to you, dear stars...

00:36.585 --> 00:39.146
"why must this happen?

00:39.146 --> 00:42.439
these little mistakes hurt so much

00:42.439 --> 00:45.183
all of these fake words

00:45.183 --> 00:48.110
all i did today... hurt so much"

00:48.110 --> 00:51.036
"i can only hide these feelings each day

00:51.036 --> 00:53.780
and stay tainted with regret

00:53.780 --> 00:56.890
and perhaps you're the only ones

00:56.890 --> 01:00.000
who understand how i feel"

01:00.000 --> 01:05.487
"shining above me, watching over me

01:05.487 --> 01:08.597
i can only wish, dear stars

01:08.597 --> 01:11.524
that you could tell me what i could do"

01:11.524 --> 01:14.634
"you saw everything, you felt everything,

01:14.634 --> 01:17.378
you've been through it all, you know it all"

01:17.378 --> 01:18.841
why can't i just stay here

01:18.841 --> 01:20.304
and find you all again

01:20.304 --> 01:22.682
until i fall asleep?

01:22.682 --> 01:25.609
dear twinkling, shining stars,

01:25.609 --> 01:29.268
oh, whatever could i do...?

01:52.682 --> 01:58.170
i don't want to go on
i don't want to, i don't want to, i don't want to, i don't want to,

01:58.170 --> 02:03.292
i can't keep going anymore
not anymore, not anymore, not anymore...

02:03.292 --> 02:06.036
so, dear stars,
so, dear stars,

02:06.036 --> 02:13.170
let me stay with you forever
let me stay with you forever

02:13.170 --> 02:16.096
please
please
