00:38.400 --> 00:44.100
Cloudless faded light blue skies

00:44.100 --> 00:48.000
surrounded the world he saw

00:48.000 --> 00:52.800
an urgency was suddenly born

00:52.800 --> 00:57.600
as that memory began to disappear...

00:57.600 --> 01:01.800
place, faces, sounds and tastes

01:01.800 --> 01:06.900
empty streets, and light gray drizzling clouds

01:06.900 --> 01:11.400
He seeked to discover the reason

01:11.400 --> 01:16.800
for such settings being so familiar

01:16.800 --> 01:17.400
mem

01:17.400 --> 01:18.000
memor

01:18.000 --> 01:18.600
memories

01:18.600 --> 01:19.200
memories and

01:19.200 --> 01:19.800
memories and frag

01:19.800 --> 01:20.400
memories and fragments

01:20.400 --> 01:21.000
memories and fragments of

01:21.000 --> 01:21.600
memories and fragments of that

01:21.600 --> 01:22.800
memories and fragments of that time

01:22.800 --> 01:23.400
he

01:23.400 --> 01:24.000
he re

01:24.000 --> 01:25.200
he remem

01:25.200 --> 01:26.400
he remembered

01:26.400 --> 01:27.000
that

01:27.000 --> 01:27.600
that mom

01:27.600 --> 01:28.200
that moment

01:28.200 --> 01:28.800
that moment breezed

01:28.800 --> 01:29.400
that moment breezed by

01:29.400 --> 01:30.000
that moment breezed by from

01:30.000 --> 01:30.600
that moment breezed by from long

01:30.600 --> 01:31.200
that moment breezed by from long a

01:31.200 --> 01:32.400
that moment breezed by from long ago

01:32.400 --> 01:33.000
he

01:33.000 --> 01:33.600
he re

01:33.600 --> 01:34.200
he real

01:34.200 --> 01:35.400
he realized...

01:35.400 --> 01:37.800
as all those moments dissolve away,

01:37.800 --> 01:40.200
just like always...

01:40.200 --> 01:45.000
just like always, he'll continue living life his way...

01:45.000 --> 01:51.600
only covered in thoughts as time fades away

01:51.600 --> 01:54.750
time and time again...

01:54.750 --> 01:59.400
no matter hours, seconds, weeks, they disappear

01:59.400 --> 02:04.200
they disappear and are left with not any meaning

02:04.200 --> 02:10.800
the time passes and then never reappears...

02:10.800 --> 02:19.200
he stays in that pure white world...
 
02:33.600 --> 02:43.200
now this time that was once at his fingertips

02:43.200 --> 02:49.200
had began to drift away

02:49.200 --> 02:52.800
so he remains in the pure white world...

02:52.800 --> 03:02.400
forever, endless, ilimitable.
