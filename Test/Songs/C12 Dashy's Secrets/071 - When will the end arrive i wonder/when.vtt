00:01.212 --> 00:05.606
When will the end arrive, I wonder?

00:05.606 --> 00:10.455
Will we be gone, as the sky turns red?

00:10.455 --> 00:15.606
After it takes me up with it forever,

00:15.606 --> 00:18.485
where might it embrace?

00:27.727 --> 00:32.424
September, the skies are blue, as usual

00:32.424 --> 00:37.273
In a classroom, out of my head, as usual

00:37.273 --> 00:41.970
Like everyday, nothing is new, and so?

00:41.970 --> 00:46.667
When will I flutter off, like the petals in the wind?

00:47.273 --> 00:53.030
As more useless time had passed, I had only lost more hope

00:53.030 --> 00:55.758
as the sunset faded away.

00:55.758 --> 00:56.970
Oh...

00:56.970 --> 01:01.364
When will the end arrive, I wonder?

01:01.364 --> 01:06.364
Will I be gone with clothes stained with black?

01:06.364 --> 01:11.061
After it takes me up with it forever,

01:11.061 --> 01:16.364
what might it become, will the world collapse?

01:35.758 --> 01:40.303
And soon enough, the sky was turning red

01:40.303 --> 01:45.455
with shatters in the floor, and over my head...

01:45.455 --> 01:47.424
Sirens and screams surrounded I,

01:47.424 --> 01:51.515
in the dark, I would say "Goodbye, Goodbye," because

01:51.515 --> 01:52.727
...it never mattered to me.

01:57.273 --> 02:01.970
When will the end arrive, I wonder?

02:01.970 --> 02:06.818
Will I be gone? There's nothing more...

02:06.818 --> 02:11.818
After it takes me up with it forever,

02:11.818 --> 02:16.667
can't I finally rest without a worry?

02:16.667 --> 02:23.030
Won't I see what it's like to be free

02:27.888 --> 02:34.888
When will I see...? Oh...
