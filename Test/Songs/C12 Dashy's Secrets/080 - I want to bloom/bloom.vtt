00:35.229 --> 00:41.835
In this life, I live on my own

00:41.835 --> 00:44.037
... At least, that's how it always feels.

00:44.037 --> 00:49.541
To me, each day is just dark, and cold

00:49.541 --> 00:52.844
Every day is never even "just okay" for me.

00:52.844 --> 00:54.495
Expectations, Reality Despair...

00:54.495 --> 00:57.248
That's it, that's all, that's all there'll ever be

00:57.248 --> 00:59.450
I'm alone, alone forever

00:59.450 --> 01:01.651
And it seems like that will never change

01:01.651 --> 01:03.853
I wish I could live in a dream

01:03.853 --> 01:06.055
And escape this hideous reality

01:06.055 --> 01:08.257
Where I'm just never enough...

01:08.257 --> 01:10.459
I'll never be enough

01:10.459 --> 01:12.661
"Just who are you?" "Just who am I"

01:12.661 --> 01:14.450
Questions ring around my head

01:14.450 --> 01:18.716
I'm none, nothing at all, aren't I?!

01:18.716 --> 01:21.468
Won't I ever escape?!

01:31.376 --> 01:34.679
...I want to bloom

01:34.679 --> 01:36.881
I

01:36.881 --> 01:37.982
WANT

01:37.982 --> 01:39.083
TO

01:39.083 --> 01:39.220
BLOOOOOOOOM

01:40.183 --> 01:42.385
I wish I could live in a dream

01:42.385 --> 01:44.587
And escape this hideous reality

01:44.587 --> 01:46.514
Where I'm just never enough...

01:46.514 --> 01:48.991
I'LL NEVER BE ENOUGH!

01:48.991 --> 01:51.193
"Just who are you?" "Just who am I?"

01:51.193 --> 01:52.982
Questions ring around my head

01:52.982 --> 01:57.248
I'm none, nothing at all, AREN'T I?!

01:57.248 --> 01:57.798
WON'T I EVER ESCAPE?!

01:57.798 --> 01:58.349
WON'T I EVER ESCAPE?! I CAN'T SEE,

01:58.349 --> 01:58.899
WON'T I EVER ESCAPE?! I CAN'T SEE, I CAN'T HEAR,

01:58.899 --> 01:59.450
WON'T I EVER ESCAPE?! I CAN'T SEE, I CAN'T HEAR, I CAN'T FEEL,

01:59.450 --> 02:00.000
I CAN'T SEE, I CAN'T HEAR, I CAN'T FEEL, I CAN'T BREATHE

02:00.000 --> 02:00.550
I CAN'T HEAR, I CAN'T FEEL, I CAN'T BREATHE, I CAN'T SCREAM,

02:00.550 --> 02:01.101
I CAN'T FEEL, I CAN'T BREATHE, I CAN'T SCREAM, I CAN'T CRY,

02:01.101 --> 02:01.651
I CAN'T BREATHE, I CAN'T SCREAM, I CAN'T CRY, WHO ARE YOU?

02:01.651 --> 02:02.202
I CAN'T BREATHE, I CAN'T SCREAM, I CAN'T CRY, WHO ARE YOU? WHO AM I?!

02:02.202 --> 02:02.738
I CAN'T SCREAM, I CAN'T CRY, WHO ARE YOU? WHO AM I?! CAN'T YOU SEE?

02:02.738 --> 02:03.273
I CAN'T CRY, WHO ARE YOU? WHO AM I?! CAN'T YOU SEE? WILL YOU SEE?

02:03.273 --> 02:03.809
WHO ARE YOU? WHO AM I?! CAN'T YOU SEE? WILL YOU SEE? I AM HERE!

02:03.809 --> 02:04.345
WHO AM I?! CAN'T YOU SEE? WILL YOU SEE? I AM HERE! I AM ME!

02:04.345 --> 02:04.880
CAN'T YOU SEE? WILL YOU SEE? I AM HERE! I AM ME! CAN'T YOU HEAR?

02:04.880 --> 02:05.416
WILL YOU SEE? I AM HERE! I AM ME! CAN'T YOU HEAR? WON'T YOU HEAR?

02:05.416 --> 02:05.952
I AM HERE! I AM ME! CAN'T YOU HEAR? WON'T YOU HEAR? ALL MY CRIES?

02:05.952 --> 02:06.488
I AM ME! CAN'T YOU HEAR? WON'T YOU HEAR? ALL MY CRIES? ALL MY SCREAMS?

02:06.488 --> 02:07.009
CAN'T YOU HEAR? WON'T YOU HEAR? ALL MY CRIES? ALL MY SCREAMS? I CAN'T SEE,

02:07.009 --> 02:07.531
WON'T YOU HEAR? ALL MY CRIES? ALL MY SCREAMS? I CAN'T SEE, I CAN'T HEAR,

I CAN'T FEEL, I CAN'T BREATHE, I CAN'T SCREAM, I CAN'T CRY, WHO ARE YOU?

02:10.100 --> 02:10.608
I CAN'T BREATHE, I CAN'T SCREAM, I CAN'T CRY, WHO ARE YOU? WHO AM I?????

02:10.608 --> 02:11.104
I CAN'T SCREAM, I CAN'T CRY, WHO ARE YOU? WHO AM I????? I CAN'T BREATHE

02:11.104 --> 02:11.600
I CAN'T CRY, WHO ARE YOU? WHO AM I????? I CAN'T BREATHE I CAN'T BREATHE

...let me free.
